# DBMS-Project-in-Oracle
This is a project for the DBMS class in which the database is the same as the one used in the Database Project in Oracle, but there are applied various PLSQL concepts, like:
- Functions
- Procedures
- Cursors
- Triggers
- Packages
- Data Collections
- Exception Handling
## Requirements:
1. Briefly present the database (its usefulness).
2. Create the entity-relationship diagram (ERD): entities, relationships and attributes must be defined in Romanian (see DBMS course, entity-relationship diagram model; no other format will be accepted).
3. Starting from the entity-relationship diagram, create the conceptual diagram of the proposed model, integrating all the necessary attributes: entities, relationships and attributes must be defined in Romanian.
4. Implement the conceptual diagram created in Oracle: define all tables, adding all the necessary integrity constraints (primary keys, foreign keys, etc.).
5. Add coherent information to the created tables (minimum 5 records for each independent entity; minimum 10 records for each associative table).
6. Formulate in natural language a problem to be solved using an independent stored subprogram that uses all 3 types of collections studied. Call the subprogram.
7. Formulate in natural language a problem to be solved using an independent stored subprogram that uses 2 different types of studied cursors, one of which is a parameterized cursor, dependent on the other cursor. Call the subprogram.
8. Formulate in natural language a problem to be solved using an independent stored subprogram of function type that uses 3 of the created tables in a single SQL command.
Handle all exceptions that may occur, including the predefined exceptions NO_DATA_FOUND and
TOO_MANY_ROWS. Call the subprogram in such a way as to highlight all the cases handled.
9. Formulate in natural language a problem to be solved using an independent stored subprogram of procedure type that has at least 2 parameters and uses 5 of the created tables in a single SQL command. Define at least 2 of your own exceptions, other than those predefined at the system level. Call the subroutine so as to highlight all defined
and handled cases.
10. Define a LMD trigger at the command level. Trigger the trigger.
11. Define a LMD trigger at the line level. Trigger the trigger.
12. Define a LDD trigger. Trigger the trigger.
13. Formulate in natural language a problem to solve using a package that includes
complex data types and objects necessary for a flow of integrated actions, specific to the defined database (minimum 2 data types, minimum 2 functions, minimum 2 procedures).
